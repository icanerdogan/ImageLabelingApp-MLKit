<h1>Image Labeling App</h1> 
<p>Introducing TagSnap: Detect Image Label AI, a cutting-edge application developed to revolutionize the way you interact with images. Powered by ML Kit's advanced image labeling APIs, TagSnap enables you to effortlessly detect and extract information about a diverse range of entities in your photos. From identifying general objects, places, activities, and animal species to recognizing specific products, our app provides an unparalleled image labeling experience.</p>

<p>With ML Kit's image labeling APIs you can detect and extract information about entities in an image across a broad group of categories. The default image labeling model can identify general objects, places, activities, animal species, products, and more.</p>
<p>You can also use a custom image classification model to tailor detection to a specific use case.</p>
<p>ML Kit’s base model returns a list of entities that identify people, things, places, activities, and so on. Each entity comes with a score that indicates the confidence the ML model has in its relevance. With this information, you can perform tasks such as automatic metadata generation and content moderation. The default model provided with ML Kit recognizes more than 400 different entities.</p>

<h2> Key capabilities </h2>
<ul>
  <li>A powerful general-purpose base classifier Recognizes more than 400 categories that describe the most commonly found objects in photos.</li>
  <li>Tailor to your use case with custom models Use other pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub or your own custom model trained with TensorFlow, AutoML Vision Edge or TensorFlow Lite Model maker.</li>
  <li>Easy-to-use high-level APIs No need to deal with low-level model input/output, image pre- and post-processing, or building a processing pipeline. ML Kit extracts the labels from the TensorFlow Lite model and provides them as a text description.</li>
</ul>
